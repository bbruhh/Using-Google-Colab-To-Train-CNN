# Using-Google-Colab-To-Train-CNN

#All the code and datasets that are Taken from the tutorial of pyimagesearch, Keras Multi label Classification, To get to know about how code works, please visit the link https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/07/multi-label-classification-with-keras/

When trying to train the above network on my PC, was taking too long. As soon as I got to know about Colab Google, tried to train on it and succeded. Thus shared the overall process.

Notes,
Please don't forget to change the colab notebook settings to GPU.
Will try to upload for more complex and well known networks like Googlenet, Alexnet if get time.
